<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Class Hierarchy and Inheritance:** The application showcases the concept of class hierarchy and inheritance in object-oriented programming. It demonstrates how the Student and Teacher classes inherit from the base Person class, inheriting its attributes and methods while also adding their own specific attributes and behaviors. This feature allows for code reuse, modularity, and the organization of related classes.
- **Attribute Access and Modification:**  The Person class provides getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying attributes such as name and age. This feature enables users to retrieve and update the information associated with a person object, allowing for dynamic manipulation of the object's state.
- **Permission and Services Check:**  The application includes a can_use_services? method that determines if a person can use certain services based on their age or parental permission. It showcases the use of conditional logic to make decisions and provide access control. This feature allows for the implementation of customized permission rules and restrictions based on the person's age or specific circumstances.
