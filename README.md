<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Decorator Design Pattern:** The project utilizes the Decorator design pattern to enhance and modify the behavior of objects dynamically. By applying decorators, you can add new functionality or modify existing behavior without altering the original object's structure. This pattern promotes flexibility and extensibility in the project's design.

- **Name Decoration:** The Decorator pattern is specifically used to decorate names in this project. It demonstrates how multiple decorators can be applied to a base object, such as a person's name, to provide additional features or transformations. In this case, the project showcases two decorators, including the CapitalizeDecorator and TrimmerDecorator, which respectively capitalize and trim the names.

- **Modular and Extensible Design:** The project's design follows a modular and extensible approach. By separating concerns into different classes and files, such as the Person class, Decorator class, and specific decorator implementations, the codebase becomes more organized and maintainable. This design allows for easy addition of new decorators or modifications to existing ones, promoting code reusability and scalability.
